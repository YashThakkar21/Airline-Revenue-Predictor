# Airline-Revenue-Predictor

## Project Overview
As part of Point72 Data Scholars Program, I built a prediction model on the future revenues of United Airlines using historical data and advanced data science techniques. The aim is to build a robust predictive model to assist an asset management firm in making informed investment decisions.

## Data Description
The project utilizes several datasets, including:
- airline_revenues.csv: Contains the quarterly revenue history for major US airlines.
- united_costs.csv: Contains the fuel cost history for United Airlines.
- oil_prices.csv: Contains the price history of kerosene.
- Additional data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).

## Results
The project will conclude with a predictive model that can accurately forecast United Airlines' quarterly revenues. Detailed results and model performance metrics will be included in the final report.
